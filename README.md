Tuples
Tuples, like lists, are a way to store multiple items in a single variable. However, unlike lists, tuples are delineated with round brackets, and they are immutable, meaning they cannot be altered once they're set.
# Create a tuple of cities
cities_visited = ("Paris", "Tokyo", "New York", "London", "Berlin")
